## Installation

This is my first python project. To use it, you need a mysql database. Rename the myconf-default.ini to myconf.ini and set the connection parameters.

Then run main.py with python3.

## Usage

Pretty self-explaining.

## Background

This is based on the phase-model, which means you will be prompted several times until you know based on a time scale.

Example

You learn a new word. It will be prompted each day until you know. If you know the word, you will be asked one day later again, the next phase is two days later. There are ten different phases: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50.
